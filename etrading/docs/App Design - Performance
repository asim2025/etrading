App Design - Performance Based
(source: https://github.com/asim2025/etrading.git)

This document contains application design guidelines to build a low latency (Java) application.
The master document contains high level ideas and references.


A. Application Design and Implementation

-	Event Driven Architecture
	Independent components that communicate with each other using messaging.  Event driven systems are inherently
   	simpler and loosly coupled.     

-	Data Structures 
   	Use efficient algorithms that execute with fewer CPU instructions (shorter path length).
   	Use data structure to keep lookups to either O(1) or O(log n). Avoid O(n) or O(n2) data structures.
   	Use lock free data structures where possible.

-	Concurrency 
   	Avoid multi-threading in core components if lock contention will degrade system performance. 
   	Instead achieve concurrency by passing messages to objects that don't require synchronization.
   	When using mult-threading then understand Amdhal Law.

-	Object Pools 
   	Create object pools to avoid too many temporary objects.
