Performance Improvement Guidelines
(source: https://github.com/asim2025/etrading.git)

Performance tuning of a low latency system is a continous exercise that requires monitoring and fine tuning 
application code, run-time (JVM) and OS.

I read several performance related articles and books while working on this project (see references section). 

Following are some of the tips/tools etc that can be used to improve performance based on my professional
experience and research: 


I. Application Design and Implementation

1. Event Driven Architecture
   Independent components that communicate with each other using messaging.  Event driven systems are inherently
   simpler and loosly coupled.     
2. Data Structures 
   Use data structure to keep lookups to either O(1) or O(log n). Avoid O(n) or O(n2) data structures.
   Use lock free data structures where possible.
3. Concurrency 
   Avoid multi-threading in core components if lock contention will degrade system performance. 
   Instead achieve concurrency by passing messages to objects that don't require synchronization.
   When using mult-threading then understand Amdhal Law.
4. Object Pools 
   Create object pools to avoid too many temporary objects.


II. Java Run-time

1. JVM warm-up
   Oracle/Sun doesn't recommend it but there are several articles/discussions where it is advisable to 
   warm up JVM so hotspot/jit can kick-in. I agree since we want the trading application to run as fast as
   possible.
2. Garbage Collector
   Understand garbage collectors supplied by Java and use the one that is appropriate for the application.
   Use Concurrent GC -XX:+UseParNewGC and -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
3. Reycle JVM
   Find a time in day to recycle JVM to clean up resources including fragmented memory left after GCs.   


III. Operating System (UNIX/LINUX)

1. Disable CPU C-States
   This prevents the CPU from going into power saving mode, which can cause latency when the CPU needs to power back up. 
   (Kernel parameter intel_idle.max_cstate=0) 
2. Disable hyperthreading. 
   This prevents other threads being scheduled onto your core and invalidating your cache. 
   (Manually achieved by echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/cpu1/online etc.) 
3. Isolate CPUs from the scheduler. 
   This prevents the scheduler from scheduling work onto isolcated CPUs, 
   preventing your work from being scheduled off, cache invalidation etc. (isolcpus) 
4. Pin threads to CPUs. 
   This prevents threads from moving between cores and invalidating caches etc. (sched_setaffinity) 
5. Lock memory pages and prefault the stack. 
   This prevents minor page faults as memory pages are paged in. (mlockall) 
6. Set the scheduler for realtime threads to FIFO / up the priority. 
   This allows our threads to preempt other threads which could be on our cores 
   (unlikely, given that we've used isolcpus) (sched_setscheduler) 
7. Move interrupts onto a specific CPU (specifically ethernet IRQs local to the NUMA node that the NIC is on) 
   (/proc/irq) 
8. Use RDMA NICs and their associated zero copy APIs for out networking (solarflare)
