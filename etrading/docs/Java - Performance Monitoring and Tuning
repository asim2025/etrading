Java - Performance Monitoring and Tuning
(source: https://github.com/asim2025/etrading.git)

This document contains Java performance monitoring and tuning guidelines for a low latency Java application.
The master document contains high level ideas and references.



A. Basics

Java Virtual Processor  (Runtime.availableProcessors() - number of virtual processors is the number of 
hardware threads on the system).




B. 

1. JVM warm-up
   Oracle/Sun doesn't recommend it but there are several articles/discussions where it is advisable to 
   warm up JVM so hotspot/jit can kick-in. I agree since we want the trading application to run as fast as
   possible.
2. Garbage Collector
   Understand garbage collectors supplied by Java and use the one that is appropriate for the application.
   Use Concurrent GC -XX:+UseParNewGC and -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
3. Reycle JVM
   Find a time in day to recycle JVM to clean up resources including fragmented memory left after GCs.
