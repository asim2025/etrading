Master - Performance Monitoring and Tuning 
(source: https://github.com/asim2025/etrading.git)

Performance tuning of a Java based low latency system is a continious exercise that requires monitoring, 
profiling and tuning of application code, run-time (JVM) and OS.

There is wealth of information on the internet and printed media. I have listed the references at the
end of the document that I found very useful in practice.

I have created separate performance monitoring, tuning tips/tools for Java, Linux and Application design.

First some definitions:
